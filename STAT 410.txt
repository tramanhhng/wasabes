1) Create a atory about how the data was collected.
2) If we have 19 variables, we need to describe each of them, what do they mean, what do they represent.
3) Report the various findings you have established so far, with interpretation (include discussion on what you find and add how useful it is) -> the objective is to predict, how does those variables help with the project
4) Never produce a summary without describing the data, we need to write a paragraph on the diagrams, tables, etc
